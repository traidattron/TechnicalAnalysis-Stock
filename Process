Done:
- set of 4 analytis indicator: EMA, AMCD, RSI, MFI, (SAR is not done)
- DC bases on expert knowledge (just stupid if-else decision)
- Profitability

Will do:
- review way to calculate indicator: in process
- review way to caculate profitability: in process
- visualize indicator: done
- pass analysis indicator into DC, SVM, CNN
- calculate accuracy (in both technical method and financial method)

Need to update:
- visualize bar chart demonstrat proportion of trade by single month
- label by my own way profitability & compare this label with their dc
